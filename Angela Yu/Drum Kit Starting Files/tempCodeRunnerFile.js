In this code, we define a separate isPrime function that checks if a number is prime or not. The isPrime function first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1 (since 1 is not a prime number). Then, it iterates from 2 to Math.sqrt(num) to check for any divisors. If it finds a divisor, it returns false. If the loop completes without finding a divisor
