Selection Sort

Here's some guidance for how selection sort should work:

Assign the first element to be the smallest value (this is called the minimum). It does not matter right now if this actually the smallest value in the array.
Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values. You will now see that the beginning of the array is in the correct order (similar to how after the first iteration of bubble sort, we know the rightmost element is in its correct place).
Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
This algorithm has a O(n^2) time complexity. You can read more about them here: https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript-computer-science-fundamentals/basic-sorting-algorithms

selectionSort([4, 20, 12, 10, 7, 9]); // [4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20]
selectionSort([0, -10, 7, 4]); // [-10, 0, 4, 7]
selectionSort([1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]
selectionSort([]);

/* Sorting Exercise - merge helper
Given two sorted arrays, write a function called merge which accepts two SORTED arrays and returns a new array with both of the values from each array sorted.

This function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space and should not modify the parameters passed to it.

As before, the function should default to sorting numbers in ascending order. If you pass in a comparator function as a third argument, this comparator is what will be used. (Note that the input arrays will always be sorted according to the comparator!)

Also, do not use the built in .sort method! We're going to use this helper to implement a sort, so the helper itself shouldn't depend on a sort.

Examples */

var arr1 = [1,3,4,5];
var arr2 = [2,4,6,8];
merge(arr1,arr2) // [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,8]
 
arr1 // [1,3,4,5];
arr2 // [2,4,6,8];
 
var arr3 = [-2,-1,0,4,5,6];
var arr4 = [-3,-2,-1,2,3,5,7,8];
 
merge(arr3,arr4); // [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]
 
var arr5 = [3,4,5]
var arr6 = [1,2]
 
merge(arr5,arr6) // [1,2,3,4,5]
 
var names = ["Bob", "Ethel", "Christine"]
var otherNames = ["M", "Colt", "Allison", "SuperLongNameOMG"]
 
function stringLengthComparator(str1, str2) {
  return str1.length - str2.length;
}
 
merge(names, otherNames, stringLengthComparator); // ["M", "Bob", "Colt", "Ethel", "Allison", "Christine", "SuperLongNameOMG"]






























/* Merge Sort
Merge Sort

Implement the merge sort algorithm. Given an array, this algorithm will sort the values in the array. The functions take 2 parameters: an array and an optional comparator function.

The comparator function is a callback that will take two values from the array to be compared. The function returns a negative value if the first value is less than the second, a positive value if the first value is greater than the second, and 0 if both values are equal.

The default comparator you provide should assume that the two parameters are numbers and that we are sorting the values from smallest to largest.

Here's some guidance for how merge sort should work:

Break up the array into halves until you can compare one value with another
Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted pairs until you are back at the full length of the array
Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array
In order to implement this function, you'll also need to implement a merge function that takes in two sorted arrays and a comparator and returns a new sorted array. You implemented this function in the previous exercise, so copy and paste that code here.
